\subsection*{Random anecdotes}

In the beginning of REMU, someone suggested a tagline ``SMT meets
SMT''. While I'm not quite doing SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
nor SMT (Statistical Machine Translation), the spirit is there.

\subsection*{On the topic}

Thanks for Eckhard Bick for suggesting CG analysis as a research
problem, and subsequently being my discussion leader. 
Your remark at the CG workshop in Vilnius has led to many fun discoveries!
In addition, I want to thank Francis Tyers for providing the invaluable real-life CG-writer perspective and tirelessly answering my questions. The latter goes for Tino Didriksen, in double. On the other side of the rule-based NLP community, Pepijn Kokke 
has contributed tremendously to the notion of expressivity of CGs.
