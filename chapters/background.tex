\section{Summary}

In this section, we have presented an introduction to Constraint Grammar, a formalism for writing disambiguation rules, and SAT, a framework or something for something.


%highlighting some key properties and relating it to other grammar formalisms.
% CG is relatively young, popularised 20 years ago, and throughout its
% history, it has been in favour of linguists more than computer
% scientists, which might explain why its formal background has not been
% studied extensively---notable exceptions being \cite{lager98}, \cite{tapanainen1999phd} and \cite{lager_nivre01}.

 


% \todo{As for its descriptive power, we can again compare CG to CFG. If
% badly constructed, both CG and CFG can analyse almost everything,
% making it useless for language description. If we accept that a
% possibility to construct a bad grammar doesn't revoke CFG's status as
% a formalism, it shouldn't do so for CG either. One can always compare
% the relative ease of constructing a good grammar between formalisms,
% but that is another topic already.}

As a bottom line, CG provides a lightweight framework where already a
moderate amount of rules can be useful (e.g. \cite{lene_trond2011} with 115
rules), although high quality requires in general thousands of rules.
Like any formalism, CG itself leaves the users with much freedom; a
single grammar can be anything from completely ungrammatical rules to near-perfect description of language.

In the following chapter, we look into existing research in connecting CG to logic, and formulate a SAT-instance for two varieties of CG.
