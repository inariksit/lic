\subsection*{Random anecdotes}

In the beginning of REMU, someone suggested a tagline ``SMT meets
SMT''. While I'm not quite doing SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories)
nor SMT (Statistical Machine Translation), the spirit is there.

\subsection*{On the topic}

Thanks Eckhard Bick for suggesting CG analysis as a research
problem. It has led to many fun discoveries.
Other people in the CG community 
% such as Tino Didriksen, Francis Tyers and Anssi Yli-Jyr{\"a}
have been very nice and helpful!
